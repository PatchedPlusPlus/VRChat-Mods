## PortableMirror
This mod allows the user to locally spawn mirrors for themselves in any VRChat world.

The mirror can be configured:
  * Allow/disallow mirror pickup
  * Toggle between full/optimized/cutout/transparent mirrors
  * Configurable mirror size and distance from you
  * Standard, 45 degree, ceiling, small and transparent mirrors
  * [UIX](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/releases/latest/download/UIExpansionKit.dll) menu to control settings  
  * [ActionMenuApi](https://github.com/gompocp/ActionMenuApi/releases/latest/download/ActionMenuApi.dll) to control the mirror from your Radial Menu (Optional)
  * Show/Hide spawned mirrors in Camera photos

### Known Bugs
* Enabling a world mirror after a cutout or transparent mirror exists may not properly hide the layer the effect is on. Disabling and Enabling the transparent mirror, or toggling between the states will fix this. 

### Planned Changes
* Ability to change world mirrors to Cutout
* Mirror only grabable when hotkey is pressed on controller
